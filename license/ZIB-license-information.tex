\ZHheading{Licensing Information for\protect\\[1ex] Commercial SCIP/SoPlex Users}
\selectlanguage{english}

\noindent SCIP and SoPlex can be used without charge exclusively for
academic purposes. ZIB also promotes the transfer of mathematics into
industrial applications and is interested in commercial applications of
SCIP and SoPlex.

If you are applying SCIP/SoPlex in such a context, you need a
commercial license from ZIB. The basic conditions for such a license
are laid out in the following.

\section{When a Commercial License is Needed}

The basic rule is: whenever you add value by using SCIP/SoPlex, you need a
license. There are two kinds of licenses.

A development license is needed if SCIP/SoPlex is used internally in your
company. Such a license is needed for:
\begin{myitemize}
\item developing nonacademic software which uses SCIP/SoPlex,
\item selling results that were obtained by using SCIP/SoPlex, and
\item using SCIP/SoPlex internally for nonacademic purposes.
\end{myitemize}

A deployment license is needed if you are selling a product that includes
(parts of) SCIP/SoPlex. In this case, you need to obtain one deployment
license per copy of your product that you sell.


\section{License Fees}

The license for SCIP includes the license for SoPlex as well, but you can
also obtain a license for SoPlex alone.

\begin{myitemize}
\item A development license costs about 2000 Euro.
\item Additional deployment licenses cost about 1000 Euro per copy sold;
  for larger quantities the fee reduces.
\end{myitemize}
   
The fees can be reduced in special situations, depending on negotiation.
This point might apply, for example, if the price of the original product
is small or SCIP/SoPlex is used within an academic cooperation.

A particular situation that has to be negotiated is when you are member of
an academic institution and are applying for grants for which SCIP/SoPlex
is an integral part.

All fees do not include taxes.


\section{Overview of Licensing Conditions}

A development license grants your company a perpetual and non exclusive
right to use SCIP/SoPlex within your company.  A deployment license allows
your company to sell one copy of a product which includes (parts of)
SCIP/SoPlex or modifications thereof in binary form.

Your company does not have the right to distribute a general purpose MIP,
LP, or CP library or an MIP/LP/CP solver based on SCIP/SoPlex. ZIB's own
rights to use and distribute SCIP/SoPlex are not affected by this
agreement.

ZIB takes no guarantee for the function of SCIP/SoPlex, and no liability
for any consequences that the use of SCIP/SoPlex in products of your
company or at your company itself may have.  ZIB also does not guarantee
that SCIP/SoPlex is useful for any purpose whatsoever.


\section{Maintenance And Support}

SCIP/SoPlex is sold ``as is'', no release is provided.

ZIB is an academic institution and not a commercial company. We do not
offer maintenance nor support. We are, however, always interested in
reported bugs and will try to fix them, but we will not guarantee to do so.


\section{Evaluation Licenses}

ZIB may grant an evaluation license for a limited time upon request that
allows to test SCIP/SoPlex for internal purposes. We of course hope that
this will lead to a regular license.
